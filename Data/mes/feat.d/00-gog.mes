{5560} Whirlwind Attack {You can strike nearby opponents in an amazing, spinning attack. When you use the full attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach.}

{5574} Defensive Roll {The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (non-magical), the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw. If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow. This only applies to non-sneak attacks. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.}

{5580} Combat Reflexes {You can respond quickly and repeatedly to opponents who let their defenses down. You may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability more than once per round.}

{5602} Improved Evasion {This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.}

{5606} Crippling Strike {A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.}
{5607} Opportunist {Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.}
{5608} Skill Mastery {The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.}
{5609} Slippery Mind {This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.}

{5645} Widen Spell {You can increase the area of your spells. Any numeric measurements of the spell's area increase by 100%. A widened spell is three levels higher than the spell's actual level.}
